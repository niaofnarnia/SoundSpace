# SoundSpace

SoundSpace is an interactive web application developed for the online music school "Sound Space". It allows users to explore and practice musical instruments directly in the browser using their mouse or keyboard.
This project was created as part of a proposal for the school's digital transformation, offering a fun and educational environment for users to engage with music virtually.

## ‚úÖ Project Overview

Users can:
- Select from three available instruments: Piano, Marimba, and Drums.
- Play sounds using mouse clicks or keyboard keys.
- Enjoy simultaneous playback of multiple notes or beats.
